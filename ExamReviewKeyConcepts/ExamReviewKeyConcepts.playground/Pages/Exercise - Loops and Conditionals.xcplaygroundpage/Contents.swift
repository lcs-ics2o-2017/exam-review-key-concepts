 ## Exercise
 
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image (the underlying image, not the planning grid):
 
 ![sloan-no-grid.png](sloan-no-grid.png "Sloan")
 ![sloan-with-grid.png](sloan-with-grid.png "Sloan")
 
 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * iteration (use of loops)
 * conditional (if statements)
 
 You can use the **Digital Color Meter** app (already installed on your Mac) to find specific colours as RGB (red-green-blue) codes.
 
 You [can use this site](http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-converter-01.htm) to convert colours to HSB to use with the Canvas class.
 
 Or, if you wish, you may use the color constants created below.
 
 */

// Create a new canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 400, height: 600)

// COLOR CONSTANTS
let deepOrange = Color(hue: 12, saturation: 78, brightness: 92, alpha: 100)
let lightBlue = Color(hue: 195, saturation: 63, brightness: 92, alpha: 100)
let neonGreen = Color(hue: 107, saturation: 61, brightness: 93, alpha: 100)

// HINT: Remember that all shapes have a fill and a border.
//       You can turn off the fill or border if desired.
