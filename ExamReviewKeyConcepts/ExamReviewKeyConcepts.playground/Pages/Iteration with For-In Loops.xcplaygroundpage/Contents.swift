 ## For-In Loops
 ### Basic For-In Loops
 You use the *for-in* loop to iterate over ranges of numbers.
 Here is a simple loop that adds all the numbers from 1 to 4.
 */
var sum = 0
for value in 1...4 {
    sum = sum + value
}
sum         // equals 10 at this point

/*:
 ### Skipping values in a range
 The *stride* function can be combined with a *for-in* loop to move through a range of numbers, while also skipping some values.
 
 This is a *very powerful* concept *(hint, hint)*.
 
 For example, here how to use this type of loop to create a ladder image.
 */
// Create canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 300, height: 400)

// Line width
canvas.defaultLineWidth = 5

// Draw the "rungs" of a ladder
for y in stride(from: 0, through: 400, by: 50) {

    // Draw each rung
    canvas.drawLine(from: Point(x: 100, y: y), to: Point(x: 200, y: y))
}
/*:
 ### Counting backwards
 You can use a *for-in* loop with the *stride* function to count backwards as well.
 */
// Countdown, then blast off
for value in stride(from: 10, through: 0, by: -1) {
    print(value)
}
print("Blast off!")
